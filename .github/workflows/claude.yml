            - Code quality and Laravel/Vue.js best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations (especially for image/video processing)
            - Security concerns (especially SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
            - Test coverage and quality
            - Type safety (PHP types and TypeScript)
            - Translation system usage
            - Draft-first workflow adherence
            
            For PHP files: Focus on Laravel conventions, service layer patterns, and PHPStan compliance.
            For Vue/TypeScript files: Check Composition API usage, type safety, and component organization.
            For database migrations: Verify indexes and foreign key constraints.
            
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.' || '' }}
